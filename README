    Parse::Extract::Net::MAC48 - Parse::Extract extraction template for MAC-48 addresses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

      use Parse::Extract;
      use Parse::Extract::Net::MAC48;

      $myParser = new Parse::Extract(); 
      $myMACTemplate = new Parse::Extract::Net::MAC48();

      $myParser->registerTemplate( \$myMACTemplate );

        #returns list of matched addresses
      @addresses = $myParser->parse( $data );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Parse::Extract::Net::MAC48 - Parse::Extract extraction template for MAC-48 addresses

        MAC48 is a extractor template for use with Parse::Extract. 
        This module should be used whenever a data stream contains
        desired MAC-48 addresses and a correct, efficient parser
        is required. MAC48 has a near zero false negative rate and
        a very low false positive rate. As with any Parse::Extract 
        extraction template, MAC48 may be used in combination
        with other Parse::Extract extraction templates.

=head1 BUGS
  
  This is currently pre-alpha software.
  
  MAC48 is however now passing all test cases.

  Please be aware that it will currently match addresses 
  containing mixed case. This was an intentional design
  decision due to the ambiguity of hexadecimal.
  Unfortunately it also causes a small amount of
  false positives.

  This may change to be configurable in the future.
